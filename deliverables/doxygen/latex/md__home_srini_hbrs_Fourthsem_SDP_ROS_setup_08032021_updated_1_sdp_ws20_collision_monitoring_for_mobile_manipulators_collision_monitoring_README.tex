This work is an extension of the existing library \textquotesingle{}\href{https://github.com/HBRS-SDP/sdp_ss20_collision_monitoring_for_robotic_manipulators}{\tt collision monitoring}\textquotesingle{}. The extension here is to add the robot base as additional primitive and also to implement the collision monitoring and avoidance for the movement of base.

This library was developed for the software development project course at the Hochschule Bonn-\/\+Rhein-\/\+Sieg.

\subsubsection*{Prerequisites}

Prerequisites and instructions for compiling the library are provided in setup\+\_\+instructions.\+pdf

\subsubsection*{Installing}

For every type of manipulator you would like to monitor you must implement the \hyperlink{class_arm}{Arm} interface. This ensures that the geometric descriptions used to monitor the distances suit your manipulator. Please refer to the documentation on how to do so.

After implementing the arm you can build your project and use the monitor class. To build the prjoect, follow the instructions provided in setup\+\_\+instructions.\+pdf

\subsection*{Running the tests}

After building you may run the test located in the build directory by running the command\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
1 ./build/test/tests
\end{DoxyCode}
