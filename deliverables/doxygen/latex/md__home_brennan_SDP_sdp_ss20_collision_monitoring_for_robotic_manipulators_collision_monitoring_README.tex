A framework independent c++ library for monitoring the distance from any manipulator to obstacles, including other manipulators in the workspace. It implement concepts from these publications\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Real-\/\+Time Obstacle Avoidance for Manipulators and Mobile Robots, Oussama Khatib, 1986.
\item Biologically-\/inspired dynamical systems for movement generation\+: automatic real-\/time goal adaptation and obstacle avoidance, H. Hoffmann et al., 2019.

This library was develop for the software development project course at the Hochschule Bonn-\/\+Rhein-\/\+Sieg.

\subsection*{Getting Started}

Copy this folder to your project repository, then install the dependencies and the library by following the instructions.

\subsubsection*{Prerequisites}

To use this library you need the following dependencies\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \href{https://www.orocos.org/kdl/installation-manual}{\tt K\+DL}
\item \href{http://eigen.tuxfamily.org}{\tt Eigen 3.\+3.\+7}
\item \href{https://cmake.org/download/}{\tt C\+M\+A\+KE V3.\+5}
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{Installing}

First, in C\+Make\+List.\+txt add the subdirectory and include the header files in {\ttfamily include\+\_\+directories} alongside the dependencies\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
1 add\_subdirectory(collision\_monitoring)
2 
3 include\_directories(
4     ...
5     collision\_monitoring/include
6     /usr/include/eigen3
7     $\{Eigen\_INCLUDE\_DIRS\}
8     $\{Boost\_INCLUDE\_DIR\}
9     $\{orocos\_kdl\_INCLUDE\_DIRS\}
10     ...
11 )
\end{DoxyCode}


Second, for every type of manipulator you would like to monitor you must implement the \hyperlink{class_arm}{Arm} interface. This ensure that the geometric descriptions used to monitor the distances suit your manipulator. Please refer to the documentation on how to do so.

After implementing the arm you can build your project and use the monitor class. If you have not done so, create a build directory. Then change directories to the build directory and build using cmake\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
1 mkdir build
2 cd build
3 cmake ..
4 make
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsection*{Running the tests}

After building you may run the test located in the build directory by running the command\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
1 ./build/test/tests
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsection*{Built With}
