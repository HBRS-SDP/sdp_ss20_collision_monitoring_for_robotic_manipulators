\subsection*{Description}

This repository is a group submission for M\+AS Software Development Project. The goal of the project is to implement a given software algorithm from a research paper, while communicating with a client to add desired features. The paper implemented is a method of obstacle avoidance for robotic manipulators and at the request of the client a combination of 2 papers was implemented and can be found in the reference section \mbox{[}1\mbox{]}\mbox{[}2\mbox{]}

\subsection*{Structure}

This repository is structured to contain multiple implementations/libraries and documents for the final submission. The repository has a hierarchial structure based around the Collision Monitoring library leading to the final R\+OS package used for demonstration. The following links list the core functionalities of this repository.
