\section{Introduction} %Brennan
% Background, motivation and state of the art

%Background ---------------
%Robotic assistants
%Set trajectories
Our two papers \cite{1,2}
%Use Human feedback S.Adee,“Dean Kamen’s‘LukeArm’prosthesis readies for clinical trials,”2008. [Online].Available:http://www.spectrum.ieee.org/feb08/5957[5] M. Velliste, S. Perel, M. C. Spalding, A. S. Whitford, and A. B.Schwartz, “Cortical control of a prosthetic arm for self-feeding,”Nature, vol. 453, pp. 1098–1101, 2008.
% Dynamic movement primitives
% Obstacle avoidance
% Distance between objects
% Different shapes

%State of the art -----------
% This paper only considers the end-effector 
% Paper considers the velocity direction and obstacle direction
% Tackles local minima problem
% Does not consider distance

\addtolength{\textheight}{-12cm}   % This command serves to balance the column lengths
                                  % on the last page of the document manually. It shortens
                                  % the textheight of the last page by a suitable amount.
                                  % This command does not take effect until the next page
                                  % so it should come on the page before the last. Make
                                  % sure that you do not shorten the textheight too much.
